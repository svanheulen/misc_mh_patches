This patch will allow you to point the game to a custom DLC server. It will
also disable all public key verification, encryption and hash checking for DLC.

When compiling, you will need to point it to the proper settings file for your
region and version of the game. You will also need to provide a URL for the
custom DLC server. For example:

    armips custom_dlc_patch.s -strequ settings_file settings/jpn_110.s -strequ custom_url "http://192.168.1.139:8080/"
