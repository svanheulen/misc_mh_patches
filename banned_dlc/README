This patch will allow you to use the "Download" section in the game even if
your system is banned. This has a side effect of breaking online multiplayer
while this patch is enabled.

When compiling, you will need to point it to the proper settings file for your
region and version of the game. For example:

    armips patch.s -strequ settings_file settings/usa_100.s
